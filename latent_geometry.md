Abstract: 
Networks are frequently modeled using latent space (LS) models. Nodes are points on a manifold and the probability of a link forming between two points is conditionally independent of anything else and declines in distance in the manifold. Typically, researchers select a LS geometry (the manifold class, dimension, and curvature) by assumption and not in a data-driven way.  In this work, we present a method to consistently estimate the manifold type, dimension, and curvature out of  an empirically relevant class of latent spaces (simply connected, complete Riemannian manifolds)  given network data.   Our argument may be of more general interest in statistical geometry: we can estimate the underlying geometry in such a context when a researcher observes a noisy  estimate of a distance matrix generated by a collection of points on some manifold. We explore the efficacy of our approach with a battery of empirically-relevant simulations. We explore the accuracy of our approach with simulations and then apply our approach to datasets from economics and sociology as well as neuroscience. These document that different geometries are needed to model networks in different contexts.
