## About

I'm a second-year Ph.D. student in statistics at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/). I am advised by [Tyler McCormick](https://thmccormick.github.io/) (UW Statistics) and [Arun Chandrasekhar](https://web.stanford.edu/~arungc/)  (Stanford Economics). I am supported by an [ARCS Fellowship](https://www.arcsfoundation.org).

Previously, I was a Fulbright Scholar at the University of Luxembourg, and before that I studied math at Arizona State.

## Research

I'm interested in statistical network models and their applications in social science. I am also interested in MCMC methods, uncertainty quantification, random graphs, and random matrices.

## News
\[3/8/20\]: I am giving a talk on parameter estimation in latent space graph models at the [6th Annual Conference on Network Science and Economics](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/event/sixth-annual-conference-on-network-science-and-economics/#section2) at the University of Chicago. (3/14: This conference has been cancelled.)

\[2/20/20\]: I gave a talk to the UW undergraduate statistics club on random graphs and parameter estimation in latent space models. 

\[11/18/19\]: We submitted "Formal Definitions of Conservative PDFs."

## Teaching 
In the Fall of 2018, I was the TA for STAT 421: Applied Statistics and Experimental Design with Caren Marzban. In the Spring of 2019, I was a TA for STAT 390: Statistical methods in engineering and science with Caren Marzban. 

In the Winter of 2020, I am running a directed reading program on random graphs. Here are the [notes](Random_Graph_Project_Notes.pdf).
