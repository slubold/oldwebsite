I'm a second-year Ph.D. student in statistics at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/). I am advised by [Tyler McCormick](https://thmccormick.github.io/) (UW statistics) and Arun Chandraskehar[https://web.stanford.edu/~arungc/] (Stanford Economics). I am supported by an [ARCS Fellowship](https://www.arcsfoundation.org).

## Research

I'm interested in statistical network models and their applications in social science.
